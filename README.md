## About

This repo hosts content for [bestresourcestolearnx.com](https://bestresourcestolearnx.com/). It's the mechanism of collaboration on the project.

The website is NOT generated automatically from the repo (yet). But it's updated periodically to reflect the changes. Please fill an issue if you notice any major discrepancies.

## Project's philosophy

The goal of the project is to collect best learning resources on IT topics to help people learn more effectively. You need to define what is "best" to do this. One approach would be to use some objective metric like the number of mentions, amazon reviews, and so on. We take another, opinionated approach.

Each topic is curated by a single person that studies and compares all resources on that topic. This person forms an idea of what the best learning path should look like. The list of recommended resources turns out to be subjective but consistent.

Anyone is very much welcome to contribute by suggesting resources and any other improvements. The opinionated approach only means that there is someone responsible for the topic who ensures that the suggestions fit the overall picture.

If you're interested in adding new topics on the website and curating them, let's discuss it! Drop me an email: victor@tenthousandmeters.com.

## Content guidelines

There are no strict rules about the content, but there are some principles that the project follows:

1. Any topic can be covered. The only requirement is that it's related to IT and is non-trivial enough so we can provide some value by recommending the resources to learn it.
2. The topics are organized into the hierarchy. There are many ways to do this. We keep the hierarchy flat (2 levels at the moment). If the topic needs subtopics, it's important enough to be at the top level.
3. Each topic has a list of resources and a description. The purpose of the topic description is to provide the context for further learning. It may define the topic, give historical background, describe its usage and importance, include links to Wikipedia and other useful places.
4. Each resource has a description as well. It should tell about resource's content and target audience so learners can quickly determine if the resource suits them. The description may also provide some guidance on how to use the resource (e.g. it's a documentation with a complicated structure).
5. Different resources target different audiences. Put first resources that are relevant for everyone such as official docs, then general resources for beginners, intermediate and advanced learners, then more specialized resources that cover certain aspects of the topic.
6. Less is better. Don't add a resource if it does not stand out from those already added. Some reasons to add a resource are: it's better; it's free; it targets a new audience; it's an underrepresented content type, such as a video course.

## How to contribute

If you want to suggest a new resource, just open an issue. The person who curates the topic will look at it and make all the necessary steps to add it to the website. This is more flexible that opening a PR. 

If you want to become a topic curator, please drop me an email: victor@tenthousandmeters.com. I'd like to learn a bit about you, what topics you're interested in, and what you can cover.
