## Description

**Django** is the most popular and mature Python web framework. It was created by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison to power newspaper websites. In 2005 they released it to open source. Today, Django is [one of the most popular web frameworks](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-popular-technologies-web-frameworks-and-technologies) that runs thousands of websites including [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/), and [Disqus](https://disqus.com/).

Django is a framework with "batteries included". Besides basic functionality like URL routing and HTTP-related utilities, it provides an ORM, database migrations, a template engine, forms validation, authentication system, and much more. Django's killer feature is a built-in admin interface that lets you manage your app's content with a UI.

Django's "batteries included" approach is the opposite of that taken by micro-frameworks like [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/), which provide only a minimal set of features and leave you to integrate any extra functionality through third-party libraries. One advantage of Django for beginners is that it makes a lot of choices for them.

Django shines in building full-stack web applications with server side rendering. It wasn't designed for building APIs like [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), but [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) makes Django a good tool for this job as well.

The documentation is so good that you'll hardly need other resources to learn Django. And it's big. The [Getting started guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/) shows how to build a simple poll app. [Topics](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/) cover key parts of Django in more detail. The are also [How-to guides](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/howto/) to answer common questions and [API Reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/) to look up specific settings, commands, functions, and classes. Beware that Topics cover many things you'd expect to find in API Reference. Use [Table of contents](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/contents/) and [Index](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/genindex/) to navigate around efficiently.
