## Resources

[Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/)
free • resource
The documentation is so good that you'll hardly need other resources to learn Django. And it's big. The [Getting started guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/) shows how to build a simple poll app. [Topics](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/) cover key parts of Django in more detail. The are also [How-to guides](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/howto/) to answer common questions and [API Reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/) to look up specific settings, commands, functions, and classes. Beware that Topics cover many things you'd expect to find in API Reference. Use [Table of contents](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/contents/) and [Index](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/genindex/) to navigate around efficiently.
