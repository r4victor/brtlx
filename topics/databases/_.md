This book is universally considered a must read for software engineers (and a very enjoyable one). It explores diverse space of technologies for processing and storing data: relational and NoSQL databases, search indexes, message queues, batch and stream processing frameworks, and more. You'll be able to make better decisions which tools to use for a particular application, and how to meet key challenges in the design of distributed systems such as partitioning and replication.
