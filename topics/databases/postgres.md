[Part III Server Administration](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/admin.html) is worth reading through if you manage your own database server. [Part V Server Programming](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/server-programming.html) and [Part VII Internals](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/internals.html) are for advanced users to take the most out of Postgres. And there is [Part VI Reference](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/reference.html) anytime you need to get info on SQL commands or command-line tools – take a look what's there.

[PostgreSQL 14 Internals](https://postgrespro.com/community/books/internals)
free • book • by Egor Rogov
Do you find it hard sometimes to remember transaction guarantees on different isolation levels, to understand which index type to use in a particular case, or to figure out why an SQL query takes so long to execute. You'll be able to answer such questions without ready-made recipes and quick-fix patches if you understand how Postgres works under the hood. This book presents this complicated topic in a very accessible way.
