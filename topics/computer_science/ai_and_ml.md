paid • book • by Stuart Russell, Peter Norvig • 2020-04-28
The authoritative, most-used AI textbook, adopted by over 1500 schools. It explores the full breadth of AI, which encompasses logic and probability; perception, reasoning, learning, and action; fairness, trust, social good, and safety; and applications that range from microelectronic devices to robotic planetary explorers to online services with billions of users.

[Deep Learning with Python, 2nd edition](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition)
paid • book • by François Chollet • 2021-10-01
This is a beginner-friendly guide on how to build and train neural networks with Keras and TensorFlow by the author of Keras. You'll get hands-on experience in solving all kinds of ML problems including tabular data classification and regression, text classification, image classification, timeseries forecasting, machine translation, text generation, and image generation. And you'll learn about the fundamental and most recent deep learning methods to solve those problems: densely connected networks, convolutional networks (CNNs), recurrent networks (RNNs), transformers, autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). This book offers a unique blend of practical advice, deep learning theory, and insights into the nature of intelligence and cognition.
