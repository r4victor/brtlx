## Description

**Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**) is a cloud computing platform with over 200 services for compute, storage, databases, analytics, and more. AWS pioneered the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) market by launching [Simple Storage Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3 "Amazon S3") (S3) and [Elastic Compute Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud") (EC2) in 2006. Now it's the leading cloud provider with [34% market share](https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/).
