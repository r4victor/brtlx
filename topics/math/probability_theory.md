Probability is a mathematical concept, and this book helps you see what it really is. The text is comprehensive and rigorous, with a focus on theory. The [first volume](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-72206-1) starts with elementary probability and helps you build an intuition for key concepts. Then it presents probability axioms and develops the measure-theoretic foundations of probability theory. The [second volume](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-72208-5) goes deeper into the theory of stochastic processes including martingales and Markov chains.
