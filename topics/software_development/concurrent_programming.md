[Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/titles/pb7con/seven-concurrency-models-in-seven-weeks/)
paid • book • by Paul Butcher • 2014-07-01
This book is an excellent survey of different approaches to concurrency and parallelism: traditional threads and locks, functional programming, Clojure's separation of identity and state, the actor model, Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), data parallelism, and the Lambda Architecture.

[Java Concurrency in Practice](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321349601)
paid • book • by Brian Goetz, Tim Peierls, Joshua Bloch, and others • 2006-05-09
This book is the best guide on concurrent programming with threads. It covers threads-and-locks fundamentals, concurrent collections, the producer-consumer pattern, and thread pools among other things, and gives a lot of practical advice on how to design, test, and debug multithreaded programs. Despite being focused on Java 5, the content applies to any other language and remains very much relevant today.
