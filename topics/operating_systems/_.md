[Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
free • book • Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau, Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau • 2018-08-01
This book is the best introduction to the world of operating systems. It is centered around three conceptual pieces of an OS: virtualization, concurrency, and persistence. In understanding the conceptual, you'll learn the practical, including how real operating systems schedule CPU, manage memory, and store files persistently. The clear writing, well-thought structure, and exercises make this book a true gem.

[Modern Operating Systems, 5th edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/013359162X/)
paid • book • Andrew Tanenbaum, Herbert Bos • 2022-05-29
This book evolved from famous [Operating Systems: Design and Implementation](https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Andrew-S-Tanenbaum/dp/0131429388), which focused on [MINIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix) and inspired young Linus Torvalds to create Linux. It's the most comprehensive take on the subject that covers all components of a modern OS with relevant examples from Linux and Windows.
