## Description

C is a general-purpose programming language created in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson at Bell Labs. The development and success of C is tightly coupled with the that of the [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) operating system. Thompson created Unix in 1969, and in 1973, together with Ritchie, rewrote Unix from assembly to C. As Unix and later Unix-based operating systems spread, C gained adoption as well. C has been ranked among the top programming languages for decades and continues to be widely used today, primarily in system programming.

The ability to read and understand C code is a crucial skill for a software developer since C underlies most software systems that we build upon. Notable C codebases include [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux), [Postgres](https://github.com/postgres/postgres), [redis](https://github.com/redis/redis), [nginx](https://github.com/nginx/nginx), and [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython).

The C Programming Language book written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie in 1978 served as the de facto standard for the language for many years. In 1989 C was first standardized as ANSI C. Later revisions of the standard are maintained by ISO and include C99, C11, and C17.

The crucial companion to C is the [C standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library). It provides macros, type definitions and functions for tasks such as string handling, mathematical computations, input/output processing, memory management, and several other operating system services. It's described by the ISO C standard. It's also described by [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX), which makes it an essential part of any Unix-like operating system.

## Resources

[The C Programming Language, 2nd edition](https://www.amazon.com/Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628)
paid • book • by Brian Kernighan, Dennis Ritchie • 1988-03-22
"Don't read any further until you have this book". The first edition, known as K&R, was the primary source of knowledge on the language. The second edition with ANSI C updates continues to be an excellent introduction to C. It covers all the C essential features and contains readable references on the language and the standard library. Note, however, that you'll need to check other resources as well for the recent C updates and guidance on the design of real-world C programs. Overall, K&R is an exemplar of technical writing produced by two greats in the field.
