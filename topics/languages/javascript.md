## Description

**JavaScript** (a.k.a. **JS**) is a programming language developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995. It was the first programming language that browsers could execute. Together with HTML and CSS, it became the backbone of web development. Today, you can compile C, Rust, Go and other languages to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), and run it in a browser, but JavaScript remains the only language that browsers support directly. Because of this multi-decade web dominance, JavaScript is one of the [most popular languages in the world](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-most-popular-technologies).

During browser wars, there were multiple versions of JavaScript including then popular [JScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JScript) adopted by Microsoft. In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to the [Ecma International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International) organization to write a standard specification for the language. This standardized JavaScript was called [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript). New ECMAScript versions continue to be released on a yearly basis, the latest version being ECMAScript 2022 also known as ES13.

JavaScript is [known for its quirks](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat), and few JavaScript developers haven't experienced [JavaScript Fatigue](https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-manage-javascript-fatigue/). But the language improved a lot since the early days. It is the language to learn if you're going to do web development. The [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime also makes it a decent choice for server-side programming.

[ECMAScript Language Specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-intro)
free • resource
This is the authoritative JavaScript standard. It's not an easy read, and you won't learn JavaScript by reading it – the primary audience of the document is language implementers. Nevertheless, it's the place to go to learn about JavaScript intricacies and corner case behavior. Check out [How to Read the ECMAScript Specification](https://timothygu.me/es-howto/) for a gentle introduction to the standard.
