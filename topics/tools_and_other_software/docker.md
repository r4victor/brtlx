## Description

**Docker** is the most popular [container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization) technology, a set of tools to build, run, and manage containers.

Containers help developers to distribute and deploy their applications easier. First you create an image – a set of files and metadata that fully describe you app's environment such as an OS distribution, system and app dependencies, and the source code. The you run containers – isolated processes created from the image.

The documentation is great, but you need to know how it's structured to learn about Docker efficiently. [Overview](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) describes what Docker is. The [Get started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) guide walks you through an example of using Docker. Other [Guides](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) cover different aspects of Docker such as development and CI/CD. [Manuals](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) show how to use particular tools as such Docker Build and Docker Compose in more detail. And [Reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/) describes APIs, command line tools, Dockerfile and Compose specifications as fully as possible.
