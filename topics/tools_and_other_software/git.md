## Description

Git is an open source [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) (VSC). It was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds for development of the Linux kernel. Today Git is a dominant VCS. According to the [Stack Overflow 2022 developer survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#version-control-version-control-system), 93.87% of developers use Git. No other technology is used as widely.

Git documentation comes in the form of man pages so you can browse it [online](https://git-scm.com/docs) or just type `man <page_name>` like `man git`. The main types of pages are 1) command and format references such as [`git-init[1]`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init) and [`gitignore[5]`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) and 2) tutorials such as [`gittutorial[7]`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) and [`giteveryday[7]`](https://git-scm.com/docs/giteveryday).  The [`git[1]`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git) page references all other pages. You'll probably start with [`gittutorial[7]`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) . Going through the Git man pages is a rough, fast-paced way to learn Git. For a more detailed introduction, there is also [Git User’s Manual](https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual).

This is an amazing article that shows what happens under the hood when you type Git commands. You'll see that Git stores all files, directories, and commits of a project as objects on the filesystem, and that the states of the repository are represented as the trees of those objects.
